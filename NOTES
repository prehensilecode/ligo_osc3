Talk to Masahiro re glitch monitor:

Signal is high-pass filtered.
Set thresholds above and below the running average by N times 
standard deviation.  When signal goes above threshold, tag it
as a possible start.  The next one above threshold is possible
end.  Wait for some period of time.  If all quiet, last possible
end is the end, Else tag new possible end, and wait again.
(A little like lockloss.)
