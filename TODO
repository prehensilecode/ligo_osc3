    Suggestions:

       frequency -- meta -- number of occurences in given time interval 

       For value* conditions: 
          specify thresholds in terms of sigma (std dev.)

6.  Transitup and transitdown.

       DONE: 2001-Feb-15

7.  meanabove

       DONE meanabove: 2001-Feb-22

8a.  abspowerabove

       DONE: 2001-Feb-22

 b.  Need to check Parseval's      

       DONE: 2001-Feb-22

9.  Fix up OSCBoolean word tokens to accept digits not in the
    first position.

       Nothing needed: already handled

10. Fix up OperStateCondList::parseAtomicParams() to deal with OSCs that
    have more than one parameter which are listed non-alphabetically in 
    the config file.  (See line #528)

       DONE: 2001-Feb-21

11. Update docs.

12. C++ replacement for strtok_r(). Using stuff like .find()
    and .substr(), maybe.

       Partially DONE: removed strtok_r() from parseAtomicParams()

13. Testing:

    1. Valueabove     -- OK
    2. Valuebelow     -- OK
    3. Valuerange     -- OK
    4. Meanabove      -- OK    2001-Mar-9
    5. Abspowerabove  -- OK - passes Parseval's, but not checked value of PSD
    6. Boolean        -- OK  
    7. Transitup      -- OK    2001-Feb-22
    8. Transitdown    -- OK    2001-Feb-22

14. Integrate with DMT viewer: talk to Ed Daw.

        see 17.

15. Read parameters from named channels.

      See item 20.

16. "ignore" keyword

        DONE -- 2001-Mar-09

17. Integrate with DMT viewer: talk to Ed Daw.

18. Implement OperStateCondList::newOperStateCond() method?

19. Implement OperStateCondList::setOutStream() method.

20. Read parameters from channels.

       Almost there for OSCvalueabove.  Trickiness because TSeries::refDVect()
       is private.  Would like to avoid allocating a whole array of data just
       to read one parameter. 
            -- Bit the bullet. We are now allocating an array of data
               every Frame, and then deallocating.

       Oops. Have to fix OperStateCondList::parseAtomicParams(). 2001-Mar-14
            -- Fixed

21. Want to add allvaluesabove, etc which turn on if ALL values in the
    channel satisfy the condition, rather than any (as is the case
    right now).

        Modified. See 22.

22. Instead of new conditions "allvaluesabove" etc, add a new parameter
    called "portion" (or something TBA) ranging from 0 to 100, specifying
    the percentage of the data needed to satisfy the condition.  A negative
    number (the default) means that having any value in the data stream
    satisfying the condition satisfies the OSC.

    OK. Call it "fraction".

       DONE.  2001-Mar-11

23. After trying out the above, I would like optional parameters.

       DONE.  2001-Mar-11

24. *** Seems to be problem with constructing valueabove ***
    See  
      Test_Valueabove     valueabove "H2:LSC-AS_I" threshold=49.7

       DONE: was problem with optional parameters. 2001-Mar-13

25. ? Maybe put in range of legal values of parameters ?

26. Force fraction to be <= 1.

      DONE. 2001-Mar-14

27. Move constructor debug message to OperStateCond

      DONE. 2001-Mar-16

28. Read bitmasks in HEX and Octal format. (0x...)

      DONE. 2001-Mar-19

29. Deadtime for Transit OSCs.
      
      DONE. 2001-Mar-19

30. Add section about "include" and "ignore" directives to docs.

31. Don't abort if satisfied() is called with non-existent OSC.

32. In OSCs that depend on power spectrum, we thrash because we
    allocate a new FSeries and a new FSpectrum on every pass through
    ProcessData.  Want to put this in the constructor, but then the
    issue is that we may be carrying around lots of unused memory if
    those conditions are not actually used.

    Current solution: put the declaration in the constructor:
    initialization is allocation.

    If,later on, we have tons of conditions that are carried around
    without actually being checked, we'll deal with it.
   

33. Fix OperStateCondList::setDebug(std::string oscname, int dbg) to 
    check that an OSC with oscname actually exists.

     DONE.


34. Maybe want to have option that will allow OSC to return the value
    it looked at to decide if the condition is satisfied.


35. More conditions:

    Rate conditions on the values, and averages of the time series.

       DONE.

    Glitches, per Masahiro.
    Earthquake, per Rauha.


36. Use readParamsFromChanMaybe() in ALL OSCs.

       DONE.

37. FIXME FIXME FIXME!!! reading params from channels don't work 
    the way we really want it to.  Fixup the Param class.

    Hmmmmm.  Seems I've done it with 
    OperStateCond::readParamsFromChansMaybe(). Works well
    enough. Consider it DONE.

38. FIXME FIXME FIXME: If we have only one abspowerabove or
    valueabove or valuebelow OSC, it dumps core.
    Two conditions also. 
    DOH! It helps if I don't ask watchedQuantity() for a non-existent
    OSC.

       DONE.

39. Fix up docs to include info about watchedQuantity() method and
    TSWindow class.


40. Fix exception throws in TransitUp and TransitDown.

41. Update RMS computation. FSeries class has faster implementation 
    Power() than FSpectrum.
